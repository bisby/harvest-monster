## Roadmap

First and foremost, this is a passion project built with the intent to meet three specific needs:

1. A non-intrusive way to quickly convert in-game crafts to an organized list of sellable crafts.
2. An efficient way to automatically list crafts for sale and update their status when sold.
3. A way to deliver quality-of-life enhancements to keep the player's focus on playing the game.

With that in mind, there are a handful of features and enhancements that should be considered in the future. Features being actively considered, discussed, and planned can be found [in the discussions section](https://github.com/ryanbarr/harvest-monster/discussions). Here are a few broad examples for enhancements and feature additions that may be considered:

* Application performance improvements, such as moving Tesseract into a web worker and instantiating it on initial load.
* Improved OCR configuration and training, such as supplying a character whitelist or experimenting with page segmentation modes.
* Enhanced support for Mac and Linux platforms, such as drag and drop support for screenshots.
* Potential community-focused features, such as a willing-to-buy section or player blacklist integration.
* New features that increase scope, such as sales history/statistics or support for bench crafts and player services.
